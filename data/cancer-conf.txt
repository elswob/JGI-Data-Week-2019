The Breast and Ovarian Cancer protein, BRCA1, in DNA replication and repair

16 May 2019, 13.00 - 14.00, C42 Biomedical Sciences Building

Professor Jo Morris (University of Birmingham)

A School of Biochemistry seminar, hosted by Anna Chambers

Jo is interested in the way our cells maintain and repair our genome, keeping our DNA intact, with a particular interest in the functions of the breast and ovarian cancer predisposition protein BRCA1 and the way it works in controlling DNA resection and DNA replication. She also works on the small modifier proteins, ubiquitin and SUMO and is interested in how these change the way that proteins behave in order to aid DNA repair and DNA replication.

The breast and ovarian cancer predisposition protein promotes homologous recombination DNA repair. This is the basis of the sensitivity of BRCA1 deficient cancers to many DNA-damaging therapeutics, such a platinums and PARP-inhibitors. 

In this seminar Prof Morris will address the new findings of how BRCA1 enables homologous recombination, in regulating resection and recombination and how these results might inform new treatments and or treatment choices. Moreover, recently the pathway of replication fork protection by homologous recombination proteins, including BRCA proteins is also important for treatment responses. How protection of stalled forks is achieved and how relevant it is to cancer development will be discussed.
